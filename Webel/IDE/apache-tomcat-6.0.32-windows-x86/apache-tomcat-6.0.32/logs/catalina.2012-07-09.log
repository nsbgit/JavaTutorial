SEVERE: The web application [/CCE] created a ThreadLocal with key of type [com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.ContainerImpl$10] (value [com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.ContainerImpl$10@1a4505c]) and a value of type [java.lang.Object[]] (value [[Ljava.lang.Object;@d5dee4]) but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
